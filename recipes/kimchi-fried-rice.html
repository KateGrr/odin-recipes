            <h2>About this dish:</h2>
            <p>Kimchi fried rice is a popular Korean dish that can be easily adapted for vegetarians. This vegetarian
                version of the dish substitutes bacon or pork belly with eggs or tofu, making it a healthy and flavorful
                alternative. The dish is made by stir-frying cooked rice with kimchi, tofu, and a variety of vegetables
                such as carrots, onions, and scallions. The combination of the bold and spicy flavors of kimchi with the
                savory and umami taste of tofu creates a delicious and satisfying meal.</p>
            <p>Kimchi fried rice is a great way to use leftover rice and can be enjoyed as a quick and easy weeknight
                dinner or as a flavorful brunch.</p>
            <p><i>* If you don't have leftover rice on hand, cook a batch of rice and spread it over plates or a large
                    baking sheet to cool. Let the rice dry out for an hour or two. Freshly cooked rice has too much
                    moisture, so it's not ideal for fried rice.</i></p>

            <h2>How to make:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In a wok or a large saut√© pan, heat 1 1/2 tablespoons of oil over medium-high to high heat.</li>
                <li>Add the onions and cook until they start to turn translucent, about 2 to 3 minutes. Add the garlic
                    and ginger and cook for 30 seconds to 1 minute, until they start to become fragrant. Add the chopped
                    kimchi and stir until heated through, about a minute. Add the rice, carrots and the light green and
                    white parts of the scallions to the wok. Stir to combine everything.</li>
                <li>Add the soy sauce, gochujang (if using) and sesame oil, and stir until all the rice has been well
                    coated with all the sauces. Taste the rice. If you want more spice, add another half or full
                    tablespoon of gochujang. Drizzle in a bit more soy sauce if the rice needs more salt.</li>
                <li>Add the dark green parts of the scallion and stir everything again. Remove rice from heat.</li>
                <li>In a separate pan, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil and fry up the 4 eggs.
                </li>
                <li>Serve the rice with the fried eggs. Sprinkle some black sesame seeds and nori strips on top, if
                    desired.</li>
            </ol>
